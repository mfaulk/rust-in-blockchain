## Project spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[MobileCoin](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/mobilecoin)

MobileCoin is a privacy-preserving payments network designed for use on mobile devices, written entirely in Rust. Under the hood, MobileCoin uses several technologies to provide privacy in-depth. CryptoNote-style transactions protect the privacy of senders and receivers. Transactions are processed within secure Intel Software Guard eXtensions (Intel SGX) enclaves that prevent node operators from seeing the transactions or deviating from the protocol. MobileCoin does not require proof of work. Instead, a network of Intel SGX-enabled consensus nodes agree on the contents of the next block.

The MobileCoin repo is now open source and the project is currently inviting participation in the upcoming TestNet.
